# PACMAN_GAME
***Goals of the project***

 The purpose of this project is to make Pacman game more enjoyable for a user playing the game. We added three features to improve the game:
 
 (1) being able to choose between one or two players
 
 As a game player, you will be able to choose the number of players, so that you can play by youryself or with another player.
 
 (2) the ability to choose between one to four ghosts
 
 As a game player, you will be able to change the number of ghosts, so that you can change the level of difficulty of the game.
 
 (3) the ability to customize the avatars of the game characters.
 
 As a game player, you will be able to change the appearance of the ghosts and Pacman, so that you can customize the game to your liking.
